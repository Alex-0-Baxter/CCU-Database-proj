For the Restaurant project due later in the course:

The SQL Server database should enable the following:

    Tables: Category, Menu Item (main page), All menu Items including all toppings
    Tables: Employee, Job Title, Cash Drawer
    Tables: Orders, Items, Ticket Sequence
    Index: Specifics
    Views: Tables and Joined Tables with Security built-in
    Actions: Display data retrieved, Sales, Data Protection, Data Entry
    Security: Access Control
    Reporting: Current Status, Sales, Inventory, Employee, Cook Status
    Referential integrity should be enforced as well as 1st, 2nd, 3rd Normal Forms
    Procedure(s) pre-written to ease database access by the Python program
    View(s) established to provide security and ease database access

For this week complete

    Make tables: Category and Menu Item (main page).  Note menu items include all toppings and each menu item is part of a category.
    Referential integrity should be enforced as well as 1st, 2nd, 3rd Normal Forms.
    Populate your three tables (see the Five Guys website)
    You may divide the work between your team members.
    Each member turns in the assignment so you will be sharing your work.

Requirements

Once you are familiar with the "Business Processes of "Five Guys" restaurants, use SSMS, LucidChart or a tool to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) as your new and better design for the final project.  Your challenge is to identify the entities and relationships between them.  Refer back to earlier work we did in this course if you need a refresher.  If you have questions about how the business operates ask them in class so the entire class can have the benefit of the discussion.
Submission Requirements

    Upload your SQL file
    Upload a pdf file of your improved ERD solution
